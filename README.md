# Inferential-Statistics

## Getting Started

Follow these 3 steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages (requires Python 3.11 or higher):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Datasets

Navigate to the Final Project folder and either:
- Place the provided datasets directly into the directory, or
- Run the download script to fetch them from Google Drive:

```bash
python download_dataset.py
```

### 3. Run the Project

Each of the project components can be run individually. Within each numbered folder (e.g., "1. Data Exploration", "2. Verifying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)", etc.), there is a main.py script you can run to reproduce that module's results.

Example:
```bash
cd "Final Project/2. Verifying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)"
python main.py
```
This command processes the data in that folder and produces the specified results (figures, CSVs, etc.).

## Data Requirements

You must have a file named "listings_with_goodness.csv" in the "Final Project" folder so the later modules can read it. If you don't have this file yet or wish to recreate it, you can generate it by running the script "embed_listings_in_place.py" in the "1. Data Exploration" folder:

```bash
cd "Final Project/1. Data Exploration"
python embed_listings_in_place.py listings.csv
```

This will:
1. Load "listings.csv" (or the CSV you specify).  
2. Use a sentence transformer model (downloading it automatically if it's not cached).  
3. Embed each listing's text to compute a "score_goodness" column.  
4. Save the processed data as "listings_with_goodness.csv" (one directory up from the script).

Once you have "listings_with_goodness.csv," you can run each module's main.py or the web app.

## Running the Deep Learning Web App

To launch the interactive price prediction web application (in "Final Project/6. Price Prediction with Deep Learning"), navigate into that folder and run:

```bash
cd "Final Project/6. Price Prediction with Deep Learning"
streamlit run webapp.py
```

This will open a local Streamlit web app in your browser, allowing you to provide property details and see the estimated nightly rate.

### Using the Pre-Trained Model or Training From Scratch

Inside "Final Project/6. Price Prediction with Deep Learning," there is a file named price_predictor.pth, which is the saved PyTorch model. You have two options:

1. Train the model by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will produce a fresh price_predictor.pth once training is complete.

2. Place a valid price_predictor.pth file manually into the same directory (if you have a pre-trained model ready), allowing the webapp and scripts to use it for inference without requiring a new training run.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- `Final Project/`: Contains the main project files and datasets  
  - `download_dataset.py`: Script to download required datasets from Google Drive  
  - Folders labeled 1â€“6, each containing a main.py that illustrates or performs different analyses.
- Each folder has supporting data files, code, and instructions for that topic.
